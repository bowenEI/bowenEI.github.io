{{< bio />}}

I received the B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Anhui University in 2021. I am currently a student pursuing a Ph.D degree of Computer Science and Technology in Southeast University.

When I was a sophomore in Anhui University, I entered the [Intelligent Software and Edge Computing (ISEC)](http://isec.ahu.edu.cn/main.psp) lab to do scientific research, under the guidance of [Prof. Xuejun Li](https://cs.ahu.edu.cn/2018/0323/c20806a276394/page.htm) and [Prof. Yi Xu](https://cs.ahu.edu.cn/2018/1217/c20806a276861/page.htm). My research interests include Edge Computing and Edge Intelligence. Compared to my peers, I have more profound experience in scientific research. Now my supervisor is [Prof. Fang Dong](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0102/c23024a256994/page.htm) in Southeast University.

I once went to Peking University as a visiting student for academic exchange, and [Prof. Xuanzhe Liu](http://www.liuxuanzhe.com/) and [Prof. Xin Jin](https://xinjin.github.io/) were my visiting supervisor.
